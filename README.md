# Conway's Game of Life

[Website](https://game-of-life-theta-eight.vercel.app/)

This web application lets you try out the cellular automaton devised by John Conway in 1970. This game have no players as it requires no more user input once the inital state is loaded. 

Every cell has a state of being dead or alive. During each generation, cells can either live or die based on the rules.
